# Voting App

This DApp enables users to vote for their preferred candidate and view the voting results. It also updates the vote count for each candidate immediately after a voter casts their vote.

This assignment was assigned to the Frontend Blockchain Mentees at the Web3Ladies Titan Fellowship Program.

I built this project using this flow:

1. Connect Wallet Button: this button is to get users to connect their wallet to the DApp.

2. Function to connect to the contract instance and a signer.

3. Function to get the current total votes for each candidate.

4. Function to cast votes connected using buttons.
